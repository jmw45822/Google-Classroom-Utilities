# Google Classroom Utilities

I got tired of creating assignments in the Google Classroom UI. I needed something faster for my classes. This is especially true when I just need to post due dates for assignments that are completed on other websites.

So, I created this script. It is not perfect and is a work in progress.

## How to use
Open a new spreadsheet and go to Extensions>Apps Script. Copy/Paste all of the code for each of the files in this repo. Save all changes and enable the Classroom API. Refresh the spreadsheet page and the menu should appear. 3 sheets will also appear along with the formatting and formula magic.
